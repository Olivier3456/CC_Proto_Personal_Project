About the texture that appears in the previews, 2 skins are used with a gradient of colors... the 1st skin is in "images", the other skin is preferably yours, as it doesn't have painted paint, only the first has it. ..

Right after doing the color gradient it is necessary to use a color mixer connecting the 2 skins to the BSDF...

So after, a shade mixer is used where the textures "albedo, normal, higt" were turned on... along with the textures, BSDF polishing was used to finish the final skin...

And so turning on the last shadow mixer at the material outlet...
